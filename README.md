# WeatherApp

This app was created to work on Clean Architecture & RxSwift.

## Objective and audience of the app
 The main functionality of the app is to display the current weather in the GPS location or in the city entered by the user.

## Build and install
### Requirements
* Xcode 8.3.3
* iOS 10.3 SDK
* Swift 3.1.
### Getting the code
In order to build, run and access the app, the first thing you have to do is to clone my repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RLRG/WeatherApp.git
```
It is important to remark that I have used CocoaPods as the dependency manager of the project so that you will need to execute a ‘pod install’ command in the same path where the PodFile is located to download all the third-party frameworks:
```
pod install
```
### Running the app
Open `WeatherApp.xcworkspace` with XCode 8.3.3.

Before running it, note that there are two targets:
* WeatherAppLAB: When you run this target, in the search screen, you will see an UIButton at the bottom (DEBUG) in order to open an in-app debugger.
* WeatherApp: This target would be a simulation of the app if it was going to be submitted to the App Store.
